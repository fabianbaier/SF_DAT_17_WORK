Question and Data Set for Final Project

What is the question you hope to answer? 

What data are you planning to use to answer that question? 

What do you know about the data so far? 

Why did you choose this topic?

Example:

I'm planning to predict earthquakes in California.
I will use certain data from different pages like earthquaketrack.com, scedc.caltech.edu/recent, etc..
I know not much about all the data so far but I am curious to find correlations.
I chose this topic because a friend of mine told me that Yahoo can predit the weather of the next 15hours in New York more precise through the amount of socks sold in the last 24hours then the weatherstations. I thought, having new relations through big data and machine learning where yet no connection exists is interesting. Maybe this leads to an complete unexpected new topic where I can predict certain stock market behaviour based on earthquakes er so.
