Question and Data Set for Final Project

###What is the question you hope to answer? 
I'm planning to predict earthquakes in California.

###What data are you planning to use to answer that question? 
I'm planning to predict earthquakes in California.
I will use certain data from different pages like earthquaketrack.com, scedc.caltech.edu/recent, etc..

###What do you know about the data so far? 
I know not much about all the data so far but I am curious to find correlations.

###Why did you choose this topic?
I chose this topic because a friend of mine told me that Yahoo can predict the weather of the next 15hours in New York more precise through the amount of socks sold in the last 24hours then the weatherstations. I thought, having new relations through big data and machine learning where yet no connection exists is interesting. Maybe this leads to an complete unexpected new topic where I can predict certain stock market behaviour based on earthquakes er so.
