LISTS

# creating
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]     # create lists using brackets

# slicing
a[0]        # returns 1 (Python is zero indexed)
a[1:3]      # returns [2, 3] (inclusive of first index but exclusive of second)
a[-1]       # returns 5 (last element)

# appending
a[5] = 6        # error because you can't assign outside the existing range
a.append(6)     # list method that appends 6 to the end
a = a + [7]     # use plus sign to combine lists

# sorting
sorted(a)               # sorts the list
sorted(a, reverse=True) # reverse=True is an 'optional argument'
sorted(a, True)         # error because optional arguments must be named

# checking type
type(a)     # returns list
type(a[0])  # returns int

# checking length
len(a)      # returns 7

STRINGS
'''

# creating
a = 'hello'     # can use single or double quotes

# slicing
a[0]        # returns 'h' (works like list slicing)
a[1:3]      # returns 'el'
a[-1]       # returns 'o'

# concatenating
a + ' there'        # use plus sign to combine strings
5 + ' there'        # error because they are different types
str(5) + ' there'   # cast 5 to a string in order for this to work

# uppercasing
a[0] = 'H'      # error because strings are immutable (can't overwrite characters)
a.upper()       # string method (this method doesn't exist for lists)

# checking length
len(a)      # returns 5 (number of characters)

DICTIONARIES
dictionaries are similar to lists:
- both can contain multiple data types
- both are iterable
- both are mutable
dictionaries are different from lists:
- dictionaries are unordered
- dictionary lookup time is constant regardless of dictionary size
dictionaries are like real dictionaries:
- dictionaries are made of key-value pairs (word and definition)
- dictionary keys must be unique (each word is only defined once)
- you can use the key to look up the value, but not the other way around
'''

# create a dictionary
family = {'dad':'Homer', 'mom':'Marge', 'size':2}

# examine a dictionary
family[0]           # error because there is no ordering
family['dad']       # returns 'Homer' (use a key to look up a value)
len(family)         # returns 3 (number of key-value pairs)
family.keys()       # returns list: ['dad', 'mom', 'size']
family.values()     # returns list: ['Homer', 'Marge', 2]
family.items()      # returns list of tuples:
                    #   [('dad', 'Homer'), ('mom', 'Marge'), ('size', 2)]

# modify a dictionary

# accessing a list element within a dictionary

'''
EXERCISE:
1. Print the name of the mom.
2. Change the size to 5.
3. Add 'Maggie' to the list of kids.
4. Fix 'bart' and 'lisa' so that the first letter is capitalized.

WORKING WITH PUBLIC DATA
FiveThirtyEight: http://fivethirtyeight.com/
FiveThirtyEight data: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data
NFL ticket prices data: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/nfl-ticket-prices
Question: What is the average ticket price for Ravens' home vs away games, and
how do those prices compare to the overall average ticket price?
'''

# open a CSV file from a URL (ignore any warnings) and store in a list of lists
import csv
r = requests.get('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/nfl-ticket-prices/2014-average-ticket-price.csv')
data = [row for row in csv.reader(r.iter_lines())]

data


# examine the data
type(data)      # list
len(data)       # every list represents a row in the CSV file
data[0]         # header row (list)
data[1]         # first row of data (list)

# only save the data we want #2nd row to 98th row
data = data[1:97]

# step 1: create a list that only contains events
events = [row[0] for row in data]       # grab the first element of each row

# step 2: create a list that only contains prices (stored as integers)
prices = [int(row[2]) for row in data]  # cast to an int before storing the price


Step 3: Calculate the overall average ticket price.
Hint: Calculate the sum of the list and divide by the length, and keep in mind
      that one of the numbers must be a float in order to perform "real" division.
sum(prices)/len(prices)

Step 4: Use a for loop to make a list of the away teams.
Hint: Use the string method 'find' to locate the end of the away team name,
      and then slice the string up to that point.
awayteams = []
for eventname in events: 
    awayteams.append(eventname[0:eventname.find(" at ")])

      
Step 5: Use a for loop to make a list of the home teams.
Hint: Use the string method 'find' to locate the start and end of the home team
      name, and then slice the string.
      
hometeams = []
for eventname in events: 
    hometeams.append(eventname[eventname.find(" at ")+4:eventname.find(" Tickets ")])
 
     
Step 6: Create a list of prices for Ravens (or 49ers or whatever) home games.
Hint: Use the zip function to pair home teams and prices, use a for loop to
      iterate through both home teams and prices at once, and then add a condition
      to only save the price if the team is the Ravens.
      
hometeams_and_prices = zip(hometeams, prices)
sf_home_prices = []
for i in range(len(hometeams_and_prices)):
        if hometeams_and_prices[i][0] == "San Francisco 49ers":
            print hometeams_and_prices[i][0]
            print hometeams_and_prices[i][1]
            sf_home_prices.append(hometeams_and_prices[i])
            
        else:
           None
            
      
Step 7: Create a list of prices for Ravens away games.

awayteams_and_prices = zip(awayteams, prices)
sf_away_prices = []
for i in range(len(awayteams_and_prices)):
        if awayteams_and_prices[i][0] == "San Francisco 49ers":
            print awayteams_and_prices[i][0]
            print awayteams_and_prices[i][1]
            sf_home_prices.append(awayteams_and_prices[i])
            
        else:
           None

Step 8: Calculate the average of each of the price lists.

summary_home_price = []
for i in range(len(sf_home_prices)):
    summary_home_price.extend([sf_home_prices[i][1]])
#__builtins__.sum(summary_home_price)
sum(summary_home_price)/len(summary_home_price)
